Using app.config.from_envvar('APP_CONFIG') in Flask allows you to load configuration from a file path specified in an environment variable named APP_CONFIG. This is a convenient way to dynamically load configuration settings from an external file specified by the environment.

Here's how you can use from_envvar method:

    Set Environment Variable:
    Set an environment variable named APP_CONFIG to the path of the configuration file you want to load.

    For example, if you have a configuration file named config.py in your project directory, you can set APP_CONFIG to the path of this file:

    bash

export APP_CONFIG="/path/to/config.py"

Make sure that the path you provide is correct and points to the location of your configuration file. The path can be relative (e.g., "./config.py") or absolute (e.g., "/home/user/project/config.py").

Load Configuration in Flask Application:
In your Flask application code (typically in your app.py or main application file), use from_envvar method to load configuration from the file specified by the environment variable.

python

    from flask import Flask

    app = Flask(__name__)

    # Load configuration from file specified by APP_CONFIG environment variable
    app.config.from_envvar('APP_CONFIG')

By using from_envvar, you can separate your configuration settings from your application code and easily switch between different configurations by setting the APP_CONFIG environment variable accordingly.

Make sure that the configuration file specified by APP_CONFIG exists and is accessible by your Flask application. Additionally, ensure that the configuration file is in the correct format (e.g., Python file with KEY = VALUE pairs) and that it defines the configuration settings needed by your Flask application.
