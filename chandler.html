				<div class="standard-textp">
					Chandler's complex personality, marked by a unique blend of humor, wit and vulnerability, contributes to his status
					as a beloved and memorable character in television history.
				</div>
				<div class="standard-textp">
					Physically, Chandler is of average height, with a lean and somewhat lanky build. He has a slightly rounded face,
					accented by a prominent nose and a charming smile that often hides his deeper emotions. His hair, typically styled in a
					slightly messy manner, is a light brown color, complementing his hazel eyes that shimmer with intelligence and mischief.
				</div>

				<!-- Text Paragraphs with pic - Achieved with bootstrap. I used row and colums approach instead of a floating pic, because it's a more device responsive approach -->
				<div class="row align-items-center">
					<div class="col-lg-8 col-xl-7">
						<div class="standard-textp">
							Chandler's fashion sense is best described as casual and comfortable, often seen in button-down shirts, loose-fitting
							sweaters, and khaki pants. He embraces a somewhat nerdy aesthetic, with an affinity for wearing vintage and novelty T-shirts
							that reflect his quirky sense of humor.
						</div>
						<div class="standard-textp">
							But it is Chandler's personality that truly makes him stand out. He possesses an uncanny ability to defuse tense situations
							with his quick wit and sarcastic remarks, often using humor as a defense mechanism. Chandler is notorious for his razor-sharp,
							self-deprecating sense of humor, and his sarcastic one-liners have become iconic in the series.
						</div>
						<div class="standard-textp">
							Despite his constant jokes, Chandler has a deep-rooted vulnerability that stems from a troubled childhood. His parents'
							dysfunctional relationship and their subsequent divorce left a lasting impact on him, leading to his defense mechanism of
							using humor as a shield. This vulnerability often surfaces in moments of self-doubt and fear of intimacy, making him relatable
							and endearing to audiences.

					and situations around him. His job as a data processor may seem mundane, but his intelligence shines through his quick thinking
					and problem-solving abilities.
				</div>
				<div class="standard-textp">
					Throughout the series, Chandler experiences significant character growth. He transitions from a commitment-phobic, jaded
					individual to a more mature, loving partner and friend. His relationship with Monica Geller, his eventual wife, is a testament
					to his emotional growth and capacity for love and loyalty.
				</div>
				<div class="standard-textp">

					Joey Tribbiani, and their bromance provides many memorable comedic moments. Chandler's loyalty and support are evident in his
					relationships with Rachel, Ross, Phoebe, and especially Monica, whom he considers his soulmate.
				</div>
